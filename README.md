# Montgomery-Crime-Explorer

This GitHub repository contains the code and resources for analyzing crime statistics in Montgomery County, Maryland, USA. The dataset used in this project represents reported crimes classified according to the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) of the Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Division Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program. The data is derived from approved police incident reports and covers a period of five years, from 2018 to 2022.

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to analyze and understand the patterns of crimes that occurred in Montgomery County. By leveraging the available data, we aim to identify the types of crimes, their frequencies, and ultimately provide insights that can help the local government in mitigating crime rates within the county. This analysis will also contribute to the broader national efforts in reducing certain types of crimes and predicting future crime patterns.

## Data Description
The dataset included in this repository contains information on founded crimes reported within Montgomery County. The data is structured based on the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) rules specified by Montgomery County. It is important to note that multiple offenses may appear as part of a single founded reported incident, and each offense may involve multiple victims. However, it's essential to consider that these crime reports are based on preliminary information supplied to the Police Department by the reporting parties.

## Initial Data Analysis (IDA) and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
To gain insights from the crime data, we conducted initial data analysis (IDA) and exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques. These steps allowed us to explore the dataset, understand its structure, identify missing values, outliers, and correlations between variables. Through IDA and EDA, we obtained a deeper understanding of the dataset, which formed the basis for further analysis.

## Data Visualization and Research Questions
After performing IDA and EDA, we utilized data visualization techniques to find answers to pressing research questions. By creating visual representations such as charts, graphs, and maps, we were able to effectively communicate complex patterns and trends within the crime data. The visualizations helped us address research questions related to crime hotspots, temporal patterns, crime types, victim demographics, and more.
